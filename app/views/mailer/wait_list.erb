Dear <%= @name %>,
 
Thank you for your application.
 
We had applications from over 85 adults and only have the resources to support about 65 adults. At this point, you have been placed on a wait list.  As an all volunteer troupe, Chautauqua can be quite fluid and a lot can change between now and the tour.  Situations will change for people and there is a likely chance that some on the wait list will be added to the tour.
 
Everyone who applied seems wonderful and has lots of energy and/or skills to pour into Chautauqua.  We appreciate your application and interest.  We will contact you if more space becomes available on tour.
 
If anything changes about your timing or availability for the tour please contact us immediately.
 
Thank You,
 
The Who Am Us Committee
Amiel, Joannie, Daniel, Eben, Anne, and Harry
