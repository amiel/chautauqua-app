Greetings Chautauquan:

Wowza! 6 weeks from today, we'll be gathering for our Redwood Vaudeville tour.

We need confirmations on your plans.  There are people on a wait list and we need to know your plans so we can keep clear on our numbers.

So please, as soon as possible, but no later than 1 week from today, inform of us of your plans.  We need to know:

1)      Are you coming?
2)      For the whole tour or a piece of the tour?

Simply press reply to this email and tell us your story.

More information will be coming regarding the nuts and bolts of the tour soon.   When?  We don’t know exactly... but soon.

Love,

The WHOAMUS Committee
