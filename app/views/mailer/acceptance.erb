Dear <%= @name %>,
 
Thank you for your application. You have been accepted and we're happy to welcome you to the tour this summer.
 
We had applications from over 85 adults and only have the resources to support about 65 adults.  We now have a bunch of people on a waiting list.  If anything changes about your timing or availability for the tour please contact us immediately.
 
Sometime in May, we'll be sending out more information about the tour.  So start packing because its going to be grand...
 
Fantastico...
